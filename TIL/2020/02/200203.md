# Pull Request

## Workflow
1. Fork a topic branch from an upstream repo.
    - A topic branch is usually about a feature or a fix.
    - Request repo admin if you need a new topic branch.
2. Implement whatever you're trying to implement in the forked repo.
3. Make a pull request to the topic branch you forked from.
    - Never make a pull request to the master branch of the upstream repo.
4. After a pull request is approved, rebase your local repo branch on top of the
   updated upstream branch.
5. Force push local branch to your fork repo.

## `git rebase`
- What is it?
    - `git rebase` command reapplies commits on top of another base tip.
- `rebase` vs `merge`
    - Both integrate changes from one branch into another branch, but in
      different ways.
    - `merge`
        ![merge](https://wac-cdn.atlassian.com/dam/jcr:e229fef6-2c2f-4a4f-b270-e1e1baa94055/02.svg?cdnVersion=788)
        - is non-destructive.
        - leaves behind extraneous merge commits.
        - can pollute branch history.
    - `rebase`
        ![rebase](https://wac-cdn.atlassian.com/dam/jcr:5b153a22-38be-40d0-aec8-5f2fffc771e5/03.svg?cdnVersion=788)
        - *rewrites* the project history. **Do not** use it on a public branch.
        - flattens the hierarchy and creates a clean, linear history.
- In relation to pull requests
    - If an upstream branch is updated in the middle of working on a topic
      branch, `git rebase` command can apply the commits you have made on top of
      the updated base tip without polluting the branch history.
    - Before submitting a pull request, you can use `rebase` to clean up the
      commit history. **Do not** use `rebase` to re-write history after a pull
      request is made.  Once a pull request is made, your branch is a *public*
      branch!
    - Upstream admin has the option of rebasing pull request commits before
      merging them into the upstream branch to maintain a clean, linear branch
      history. In such a case, the rebased commits on the upstream branch are
      *different* from the fork commits. The contributor *must* rebase on top of
      the upstream branch and force push to the fork repo in order to avoid
      polluting branch history.

## Example
- We're in a local clone of a fork repo.
```bash
// before fetching upstream
$ gloga
* 7c59a26 (HEAD -> master, origin/master, origin/HEAD) and another
* 20e58eb another modification
* d585657 initial commit

// after fetching upstream
$ git fetch upstream
...
$ gloga
* 5211679 (upstream/master) and another
* e829867 another modification
| * 7c59a26 (HEAD -> master, origin/master, origin/HEAD) and another
| * 20e58eb another modification
|/  
* d585657 initial commit

// after rebasing
$ git rebase upstream/master
...
$ gloga
* 5211679 (HEAD -> master, upstream/master) and another
* e829867 another modification
| * 7c59a26 (origin/master, origin/HEAD) and another
| * 20e58eb another modification
|/  
* d585657 initial commit

// after force pushing
$ git push -f origin master
...
$ gloga
* 5211679 (HEAD -> master, upstream/master, origin/master, origin/HEAD) and another
* e829867 another modification
* d585657 initial commit
```
