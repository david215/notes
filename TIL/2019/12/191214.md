# Vim: How to use Buffers and Windows

## Buffers vs Windows vs Tabs
- In short, just use buffers to manage multiple files and use windows to view
multiple buffers or multiple sections of the same buffer.

## Buffers
- Load a file into a new buffer: `:e [filename]`
- List buffers: `:ls`
- Change to another buffer:`:b[N]`, `:b[filename]`, `:bn[ext]`, `:bp[rev]`
- Delete a buffer: `:bd[elete][N]` or `:bd[elete][filename]`
- Close all buffers: `:q[uit]a[ll]`

## Windows
- Open with windows: `vim -O file1 file2` will open both files in a vertical
split!
- Add a vertical window: `:vs[plit] [filename]`
    - If no filename is supplied, the new window will display the file in the
    current buffer.
    - Works whether the file is loaded in a buffer or not (it will load the
    file into a new buffer).
- To manage 2 vertical windows:
    - Rotate windows: `CTRL-W r`
    - Resize windows: `CTRL-W =`
