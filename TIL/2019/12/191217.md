# IntelliJ
- Use `CTRL+H` (or Navigate -> Type Hierarchy) to show type hierarchy.
    - e.g. PrintWriter -> Writer -> Object
- Refactor
    - Can introduce variables, constants, fields, parameters.
    - Can also extract methods.

# Java
- No default parameter value in java -> overloading, or better, use builders!
    - ```
      Student s1 = new StudentBuilder()
                       .name("Eli")
                       .buildStudent();
      Student s2 = new StudentBuilder()
                       .name("Spicoli")
                       .age(16)
                       .buildStudent();
      ```
- Java hierarchy
    - module (e.g. java.base)
        - package (e.g. java.lang)
            - class / interface (e.g. java.lang.Object)
                - member (e.g. java.lang.Object.toString())
    - Note that java.lang is not java.base.lang; module is just a collection of
    packages.
    - On a side note, java.lang is imported on default -> no need to import to
    use `Math.PI`.
- Lowercase acronyms in camel case for better readability.
    - e.g. vatCalculator, not VATCalculator or VATcalculator.
- Is everything an object in Java? No! Primitives are not objects.
    - On the other hand, everything IS an object in Python.
        - e.g. try `x = 1`, and `help(x)`.

# Vim
- When using help, use `i_cmd` and `v_cmd` to search for commands in insert and
visual modes.
    - e.g. `i_CTRL-T` will find info on deleting an indent instead of scrolling
    window down.
- Use `:res[ize]` maximize the height of the current window. Useful for reading
help.
