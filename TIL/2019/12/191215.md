# Vim tips
- In insert mode, `CRTL-O` temporarily changes to normal mode.
    - e.g. to jump over a character in the middle of insert mode, use
    `crtl-0 a`.
- in normal mode, `ctrl-o` jumps to previous cursor position.
    - Use `CTRL-I` or `<Tab>` to jumps to next cursor position.
    - A cursor position can mean different buffers (even different buffer
    lists).
- `:h[elp] CTRL-O` will show relevant information for that command.

# Java
- `main(String args[])` ->  `main(String[] args)`: C-style -> Java-style array
declaration.
- `public class ClassName`: `public` requires that class name match the
filename.
- `package PackageName`: package name must match the directory name.

# Bash
- `"$(cmd)"` to execute a command and also pass its output to another command.
    - e.g. `cd "$(dirname) "$(which java)")"`
