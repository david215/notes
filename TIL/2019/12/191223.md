 Clean Code

## Chapter 2: Meaningful Names
- Classes and objects should have noun or noun phrase names.
- Methods should have verb or verb phrase names.
- Pick one word per concept
    - e.g. don't use `fetch`, `retrieve`, and `get` together.
- Add meaningful context
    - e.g. `state` variable by itself vs `Address.state`
    - i.e. create necessary classes, methods to provide context.

# Design Patterns

## Chapter 1: Introduction
- How design patterns solve design problems
    - help identify less-obvious **abstractions** and provide objects to
    capture them, empowering programmers to come up with more **flexible
    designs**. 
    - provide a toolkit to help determine object **granularity**.
    - help specify **interfaces** by identifying their key elements and the
    kinds of data that get sent across an interface.
