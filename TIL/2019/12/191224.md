# Clean Code
- A function should do only **one thing**.
    - A function does only one thing when:
        - the function does only those steps that are **one level below** the
        stated names of the function.
        - you **cannot extract another function** from it with a name that is
        not merely a restatement of its implementation.
        - statements within a function are at the same level of abstraction.

# Design Patterns
- Program to an interface, not an implementation.
    - ensures abstraction and encapsulation.
    - reduces implementation dependencies.
    - results in **reusable object-oriented design**.
