## Chapter 1: Clean Code
- What is Clean Code?
    - Readability and Enhanceability
    - > [P]retty much what you expected.
    - > Clean code does one thing well.
    - > Code, without tests, is not clean.
    - > Clean code always looks like it was written by someone who ***cares***
    about [...] the craft.
    - > It's not enough to write the code well. The code has to be ***kept***
    clean over time.
