- What is Clean Code?
    - Readability and Enhanceability
        - Clean code is not only readable, but also **enhanceable** by other
        programers. After all, programming is a collaborative work.
    - > [P]retty much what you expected.
        - > You know you are working on clean code when each routine you read
            turns out to be ***pretty much what you expected***. You can call
            it beautiful code when the code also makes it look like the
            language was made for the problem.
    - > Clean code does one thing well.
        - > Bad code tries to do too much, it has muddled intent and ambiguity
            of purpose. Clean code is *focused*. Each function each class, each
            module exposes a ***single-minded attitude*** that remains entirely
            undistracted, and unpolluted, by the surrounding details. 
    - Early building of simple abstractions.
        - Go forward quickly while preserving the ability to change later.
        - Don't get caught up by implementation details to lose sense of what's
        "really" going on.
    - > Code, without tests, is not clean.
    - > Clean code always looks like it was written by someone who ***cares***
    about [...] the craft.
    - > It's not enough to write the code well. The code has to be ***kept***
    clean over time.
        - The Boy Scout Rule: *Leave the campground cleaner than you found it.*
